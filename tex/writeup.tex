\section{Introduction}
In this project, we worked with the a finite volume solver for the shallow
water equations. These PDEs model the movement of waves in scenarios where
the waves are long compared to the depth of the water. We were provided
with a moderately performant single threaded version of the code, and made
an effort to improve performance by parallelizing the algorithm. For our
implementation, we chose to use MPI as our parallelization paradigm. Our
algorithm divides the grid up into a series of subdomains, and assigns one
subdomain to each processor. Processors are responsible for calculating
the behavior of the water in their portion of the domain. They communicate
information about the cells on the edge of their domain with the
processors of neighboring domains so that information propagates properly
across domain boundaries.

\section{The Algorithm}
The general process:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Used MPI
	\item Transfer Boundary information to left and right neighbors, the top and bottom (transferring the corners to top and bottom)
	\item Transfer boundary information every $\tau$ steps
	\item Transfer time step information every $\tau$ steps as well (This is what is being used in the model anyway)
\end{enumerate}
The model
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Four different contributions to batches of time steps
	\item Give predictions for how strong scaling, weak scaling, and optimal time batching look like.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scaling and Profiling Results}
Figure this out!



\section{Conclusion}
What we would add for next time:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item More careful cache performance
	\item Tuning number of ghost cells to block size
	\item Different sized domains/initial conditions
	\item Deal with the fact that not all processors are the same
	\item Think about the tradeoff between a conservative time step and communicating every step (how uneven are the time steps really?)
	\item Communication between processors at different nodes is different than that of the same nodes?
\end{enumerate}
